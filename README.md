# File Compression & Decompression
### Introduction
To reduce the time needed for files to be transmitted over a network, Compression and Decompression techniques are very useful. Developers prefer to write code to compress files before sending them out to the network for a file upload process. Web applications get the most benefit out of it. The .NET Framework provides the System.IO.Compression namespace, which contains the compressing and decompressing libraries and streams. Developers can use these types to read and modify the contents of a compressed file.
